              studying anatomy alongside her practice, until the two became
              impossible to separate. Her classes move slowly enough that students
              can actually feel what's happening — which, she'll tell you, is the
              whole point.

              to this little studio on Virginia Street. His evenings of chanting
              have become a fixed point for many people in the community —
              something they return to without quite being able to explain why.

              Her background spans Yin yoga, Vipassana meditation, and somatic
              inquiry, and her classes often feel more like a guided
              investigation than a workout. Students leave quieter than
              they arrived, and usually more themselves.

              understanding of the body and a hard-won softness to how he
              teaches it. His Vinyasa classes have a rhythm that's easy

              senior teachers and continues to study the intersection of yoga
