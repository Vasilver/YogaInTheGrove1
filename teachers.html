              Vishal Das has been walking the path of Iyengar yoga for eight
              years, shaped by a formative year of deep study at an Iyengar
              Institute that honed his understanding of alignment, precision,
              and the intelligence held within each posture.
            </p>
            <p class="teacher-card__bio">
              His classes reflect a rich synthesis of movement traditions.
              Between asanas, Vishal weaves in elements of Tai Chi and
              calisthenics — creating a practice that flows between stillness
              and dynamic movement, building core strength while awakening
              and sustaining energy throughout the body.
            </p>
            <p class="teacher-card__bio">
              At Yoga in the Grove, Vishal brings this integrated approach
              into a space of community and devotion, inviting students to
              explore not just what the body can do, but how movement itself
              can become a pathway to presence.

              Indranudzha Das is a devoted student of Chaitanya Chandra Charan
              Prabhu, whose heart lives in the practices of harinama and kirtan.
              A gifted kirtania, he leads souls into the transformative power of
              sacred sound with warmth, devotion, and an open heart. As an active
              member of the Zelenograd yatra, he leads a spiritual community
              group, creating space for seekers to come together in devotion and
              meaningful connection.
            </p>
            <p class="teacher-card__bio">
              Alongside fellow Vaishnava devotees of Bhaktivruksha, Indranudzha
              co-founded "Bateryka" — a volunteer preaching club that blends
              music, discussion, and community in the spirit of genuine outreach.
              Through yoga evenings, Ayurveda gatherings, and online
              conversations, the club serves as a living expression of devotional
              service, bringing the teachings to life in accessible and joyful
              ways.
            </p>
            <p class="teacher-card__bio">
              At Yoga in the Grove, Indranudzha brings this same spirit of seva
              and togetherness — understanding that every gathering, every
              kirtan, and every shared meal is an opportunity to deepen our
              connection to each other and to the Divine.

              Kirtan has been the rhythm of my life since childhood, growing up in India
              surrounded by sacred sound. From a young age, I found myself leading kirtans
              in temples and gatherings — call and response rising and falling, mantras
              carrying the room into stillness. Over the years I've had the deep blessing
              of sharing this practice with communities around the world, and each gathering
              has only deepened my love for what kirtan does: it dissolves the barriers we
              carry and opens something in us that is already whole.
            </p>
            <p class="teacher-card__bio">
              I play mrdangam and harmonium, instruments that have been my companions
              through decades of practice and prayer. The mrdangam's ancient rhythms ground
              the body while the harmonium lifts the voice — together they create a container
              where even someone who has never chanted before can find themselves fully
              absorbed in the sound.
            </p>
            <p class="teacher-card__bio">
              Now rooted in Miami, my heart's intention is to bring kirtan home here.
              No musical background needed, no prior experience — just an open heart.
              Whether you come curious, seeking, or simply needing a place to exhale,
              kirtan is a practice that meets you exactly where you are. Come chant with us.
