            <p class="teacher-card__bio">
              Vishal Das has been walking the path of Iyengar yoga for eight
              years, shaped by a formative year of deep study at an Iyengar
              Institute that honed his understanding of alignment, precision,
              and the intelligence held within each posture.
            </p>
            <p class="teacher-card__bio">
              His classes reflect a rich synthesis of movement traditions.
              Between asanas, Vishal weaves in elements of Tai Chi and
              calisthenics — creating a practice that flows between stillness
              and dynamic movement, building core strength while awakening
              and sustaining energy throughout the body.
            </p>
            <p class="teacher-card__bio">
              At Yoga in the Grove, Vishal brings this integrated approach
              into a space of community and devotion, inviting students to
              explore not just what the body can do, but how movement itself
              can become a pathway to presence.

            <p class="teacher-card__bio">
              Indranudzha Das is a devoted student of Chaitanya Chandra Charan
              Prabhu, whose heart lives in the practices of harinama and kirtan.
              A gifted kirtania, he leads souls into the transformative power of
              sacred sound with warmth, devotion, and an open heart. As an active
              member of the Zelenograd yatra, he leads a spiritual community
              group, creating space for seekers to come together in devotion and
              meaningful connection.
            </p>
            <p class="teacher-card__bio">
              Alongside fellow Vaishnava devotees of Bhaktivruksha, Indranudzha
              co-founded "Bateryka" — a volunteer preaching club that blends
              music, discussion, and community in the spirit of genuine outreach.
              Through yoga evenings, Ayurveda gatherings, and online
              conversations, the club serves as a living expression of devotional
              service, bringing the teachings to life in accessible and joyful
              ways.
            </p>
            <p class="teacher-card__bio">
              At Yoga in the Grove, Indranudzha brings this same spirit of seva
              and togetherness — understanding that every gathering, every
              kirtan, and every shared meal is an opportunity to deepen our
              connection to each other and to the Divine.

              discomfort — and finds that's exactly where transformation lives.
              Her background spans Yin yoga, Vipassana meditation, and somatic
              inquiry, and her classes often feel more like a guided
              investigation than a workout. Students leave quieter than
              they arrived, and usually more themselves.

              understanding of the body and a hard-won softness to how he
              teaches it. His Vinyasa classes have a rhythm that's easy
              to get lost in — in the best way.

              senior teachers and continues to study the intersection of yoga
              and somatic healing. Her sessions are an act of permission —
              permission to rest, to slow down, to need nothing at all for
              one hour.
