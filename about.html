            <p>
              The yoga of devotion. In the Bhakti tradition, the path to union
              runs through the heart — through love, through longing, through
              the particular quality of attention that chanting can summon in a
              room full of people who have agreed, for one hour, to mean it.
            </p>
            <p>
              Bhakti teaches that love itself is the method. That the practice
              of surrendering to something larger than yourself can open what
              effort alone cannot. At Yoga in the Grove, this tradition lives
              in our Kirtan evenings, in the way we begin and end every class,
              and in the understanding that this practice is not performance
              but offering.

          <div class="lineage-col__body">
            <p>
              The yoga of the body. Hatha works with physical form — posture,
              breath, the slow negotiation between effort and surrender — as a
              doorway to the subtle. In this tradition, the body is not an
              obstacle to transcend but a precise and trustworthy teacher.
            </p>
            <p>
              Every pose holds an inquiry. Every breath is a conversation with
              the nervous system. We practice Hatha not to achieve shapes but
              to develop the quality of attention that allows us to inhabit our
              own lives more fully — on the mat and far from it.

            <p>
              It is the practice of yoking together what daily life works to
              separate: body from mind, self from other, the individual from
              something larger and less anxious than the individual. We carry
              the word lightly here — not as doctrine, not as brand, but as
              direction.
            </p>
            <p>
              A reminder that wholeness is not a state to be achieved and
              maintained through discipline. It is a way of paying attention.
              Every class we teach, every kirtan we gather for, every morning
              we sweep the floor before the first student arrives — these are
              acts in that direction. Small, repeated, sincere.
            </p>
            <p>
              The union we're interested in is not abstract. It is the feeling
              of arriving in your own body after a long day of living in your
              head. It is two voices finding the same note. It is a neighborhood
              studio where the door is actually open.

          <p>
            We started this studio because we believed that yoga — not its
            athletic cousin, but the thing itself — had a particular power:
            to address the whole person at once. The body and the mind and
            the spirit that moves between them, the part of us that needs
            beauty and silence and other people in the same room doing
            something real.
          </p>

          <p>
            We wanted to build a place where that full encounter could
            happen. Where someone could walk in carrying whatever they were
            carrying — grief, restlessness, a back that won't cooperate,
            a heart that needs tending — and leave having touched something
            true. Not fixed. Not improved. Not optimized. Just met.
          </p>

          <p>
            That is what we are still building, one class at a time,
            one breath at a time. We don't have everything figured out.
            We have a room, a tradition we love, and a neighborhood full
            of people who are looking for the same thing we are.
          </p>

        </div>

        <p class="about-closing__final">
          The door is open. Come as you are. Come wanting
          to feel whole, to feel connected, to feel at home in their own life.
